Type: Package
Title: Implementation of DTW algorithms for time series comparison
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Samira Sonfack, Sarah Eliko, Fatima-Zhara Aklila
Maintainer: The package maintainer <samira.sonfack@ensiie.eu>
Description: The package implements versions of DTW algorithms with dynamic programming.One naive version and one optimized to reduce time complexity.    The complexities of both approaches are simulated and compared  with application on financial data time series.
